# Running smoke and regression separately

[in Japanese(日本語)](smoke_and_regression_ja.md)

Split your scenarios into a short set you run every time (smoke) and a set that runs everything (regression). No scenario needs to change.
Here, smoke is the open-product-details test (made in the Quick Start), and regression is everything.

## 1. Sort them into folders

### Prompt for the AI

```text
In project1, create a smoke folder under scenarios/ and move OpenProductDetails.swift into it. Do not move AddToCart.swift.
After moving, confirm that it still compiles.
```

<details>
<summary><b>If you do it manually (click to show details)</b></summary>

```bash
mkdir TestProjects/project1/scenarios/smoke
mv TestProjects/project1/scenarios/OpenProductDetails.swift TestProjects/project1/scenarios/smoke/
```

A scenario ID (`ClassName.methodName`) does not change with the folder.

</details>
<br>

Expected result:

- `OpenProductDetails.swift` is in `scenarios/smoke/`.
- `AddToCart.swift` stays directly under `scenarios/`.

## 2. Run by folder (smoke) and run everything (regression)

### Prompt for the AI

```text
With the ios-run profile of project1, run only the scenarios in the smoke folder.
```

<details>
<summary><b>If you do it manually (click to show details)</b></summary>

```bash
../fleetest-mobile/.build/debug/fleetest run --project project1 --profile ios-run --folder smoke
```

Give `--folder` the name of a subfolder directly under `scenarios/`. It can be repeated, and it can be combined with `--scenario` and `--failed`.
Without a folder, everything runs.

</details>
<br>

Expected result:

- Only the one scenario inside `smoke` runs (the open-product-details test).

Next, run everything without naming a folder (regression) and compare how many ran.

### Prompt for the AI

```text
With the ios-run profile of project1, run all scenarios.
```

Expected result:

- Three scenarios run (one in the open-product-details test and two in the add-to-cart test).
