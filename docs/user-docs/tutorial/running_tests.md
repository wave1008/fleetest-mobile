# Running tests

[in Japanese(日本語)](running_tests_ja.md)

Run the tests you created. AI is not used for the run itself (scenarios are replayed deterministically as code).
This page runs the tests you made in the Quick Start and in "Creating tests" on iOS.

## 1. Run (in parallel on three devices)

### Prompt for the AI

```text
Run all scenarios in the fleetest test project project1 on iOS (ios-run) and report the results when it's done.
```

<details>
<summary><b>If you do it manually (click to show details)</b></summary>

```bash
# Everything
../foundation-tester/.build/debug/fleetest run --project project1 --profile ios-run

# Per class (file) or per single test
../foundation-tester/.build/debug/fleetest run --project project1 --profile ios-run --scenario <ClassName>
../foundation-tester/.build/debug/fleetest run --project project1 --profile ios-run --scenario <ClassName>.<methodName>
```

`<ClassName>` is the scenario's class name (it is inside the Swift file under `scenarios/`).

In VSCode, select a scenario in the Test Explorer and click "Run" (choose the run profile with
`fleetest: Select Run Profile` in the Command Palette; if there is only one, it is selected automatically).

</details>

Expected result:

- `ios-run` has the three devices you set up in the Quick Start and [Preparing devices](preparing_devices.md), so the scenarios are distributed to all three automatically.
- The three devices in the Device Monitor run different scenarios at the same time.
- A list of pass/fail appears when it finishes (no change to the scenarios is needed).
