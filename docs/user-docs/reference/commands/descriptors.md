# group, procedure, beforeEach, afterEach, beforeAll, afterAll, setUpDevice, tearDownDevice

[in Japanese(日本語)](descriptors_ja.md)

Structuring commands: grouping steps in the report, running arbitrary Swift as one step, and
per-test setup/teardown.

## Functions

| function | description |
|---|---|
| `group("name") { }` | Prefixes the steps inside with `[name]` in the report. Execution and failure semantics are unchanged. |
| `procedure("description") { ... }` | Names a group of steps as one procedure. You can call commands inside. The report shows only the `procedure "description"` line and folds the inner steps that passed (a failed step is still shown). A thrown error fails the scenario. |
| `func beforeEach()` | Defined on the test class; runs automatically before each `@Test`. |
| `func beforeAll()` | Defined on the test class; runs **once per run, per class**, before any scenario of that class on any device (order: `beforeAll()` → `setUpDevice()` → `beforeEach()` → body → `afterEach()`). Other devices that pick up a scenario of that class wait until it finishes. Share what it prepares with [`writeMemo` / `readMemo`](memo.md). |
| `func setUpDevice()` | Defined on the test class; runs **at most once per run, per device, per class** — before `beforeEach()` of the first scenario of that class that lands on the device. Per-device preparation. Share what it prepares with [`writeMemo` / `readMemo`](memo.md). |
| `func afterEach()` | Defined on the test class; runs automatically after each `@Test`, **including after a failure**. |
| `func tearDownDevice()` | Defined on the test class; runs **once, after the device has finished all of its scenarios in the run** (if at least one scenario of that class ran on the device). Use it to clean up after `setUpDevice()`. |
| `func afterAll()` | Defined on the test class; runs **once per run, per class**, after every device has finished the run (after each device's `tearDownDevice()`), in a process of its own. It runs only when at least one scenario of that class ran in the run. It runs whether or not `beforeAll()` passed, so use it for run-wide cleanup (for example deleting the test data you created). It can read the memo. It does not run in an interrupted run. The result goes to the run log and a report, and does not count toward pass/fail |

## Example

```swift
@TestClass
class LoginFlow {
    func beforeEach() {
        irregularHandler("#promo_modal", dismiss: "#btn_promo_close")
    }

    func afterEach() {
        terminateApp()
    }

    @Test("login succeeds with valid credentials")
    func S0010() {
        scenario {
            group("prepare test data") {
                procedure("seed the account via API") {
                    let response = httpRequest("https://api.example.com/test-accounts", method: "POST",
                                               body: #"{"email":"user@example.com"}"#)
                    response.status.thisIs(201)
                }
            }
            scene(1, "log in") {
                action {
                    launchApp()
                    type("#email", "user@example.com")
                    type("#password", account("[account1].password"))
                    tap("#login_btn")
                }.expectation {
                    exist("#welcome_text")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Notes

- **`procedure { }` is where a scenario puts code it does not want to run after a failure.** Raw Swift written directly in a scene's
  `action { }` / `expectation { }` block is not skipped when an earlier step has failed; only the body of `procedure { }` is skipped once an
  earlier step has failed (a thrown error inside it aborts the scenario the same way a failed command does).
- `beforeAll()` runs in the process of the first scenario of the class, so instance properties it sets are not visible to other scenarios — pass values with `writeMemo` / `readMemo`. The wait of other devices is not counted in a scenario's duration or timeout. If it fails (or the process dies after it began), it is not re-run and the remaining scenarios of that class in the run are recorded as failed without running. If the scenario that was to run it ends before it began (for example the app could not be launched), another device takes it over. When a run is split across machines, each machine runs it once.
- `setUpDevice()` runs in the process of that first scenario only, so **instance properties it sets are not visible to other scenarios** — pass values with `writeMemo` / `readMemo`. If it fails, the remaining scenarios of that class on the same device are recorded as failed without running, and it is never retried on that device within the run.
- `afterEach()` still runs after a `@Test` fails — use it for cleanup that must happen either
  way (e.g. terminating the app).
- `tearDownDevice()` runs in a process of its own and can read the memo. It runs even if `setUpDevice()` failed, but not on a device that dropped out mid-run or when the run is interrupted. Its result goes to the run log and a report and does not count toward the test results.
- `@Deleted("reason")` and `@Draft("reason")` mark a `@TestClass` or `@Test` as retired or
  in-progress; both are excluded from bulk runs (all-scenarios, folder, class-name) and can
  only be run by an exact ID. See
  [Creating a test class](../testclass/creating_testclass.md) for the full annotation reference.
