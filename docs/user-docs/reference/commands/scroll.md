# scroll (scrollTo, scrollDown, withScrollDown, scrollFrame, ...)

[in Japanese(日本語)](scroll_ja.md)

Content-based scrolling: search for an element while scrolling, scroll a fixed amount, or scroll
to an edge.

## Functions

| function | description |
|---|---|
| `scrollTo(sel, direction: .down, containerInference:, settle:, maxSwipes: 8)` | Scrolls until the element is found (found = success; does not tap it). It searches only in the `direction:` given. If it reaches the end without finding the element, it steps back in small drags to pick up a row the scrolling skipped over. If the list was already at its end and nothing moved at all, it fails without searching the other side. |
| `scrollDown(repeat: 1, settle:)` / `scrollUp` / `scrollRight` / `scrollLeft` | Scrolls one screenful (`repeat:` times to repeat). |
| `scrollToBottom(settle:, maxSwipes: 50)` / `scrollToTop` / `scrollToRightEdge` / `scrollToLeftEdge` | Scrolls to the edge — until the screen stops changing. `maxSwipes` is a runaway guard; hitting it leaves a note on the step. |
| `withScrollDown { … }` / `withScrollUp` / `withScrollRight` / `withScrollLeft` | Makes every `tap` / `type` / `clearInput` / `select` / `exist` / `notExist` / `findImage` / `existImage` / `hold` inside the block search by scrolling (an explicit `scroll:` on a command still wins). **`notExist` changes meaning** inside the block — it fails as soon as the element turns up while scrolling. |
| `withoutScroll { … }` | Cancels an outer `withScroll*` — commands inside resolve against the current screen only. |
| `withoutContainerInference { … }` | Disables the container-inference corrections (below) for every command inside the block. |
| `scroll: .noScroll` (an argument of `tap` / `type` / `clearInput` / `select` / `exist` / `notExist` / `findImage` / `existImage` / `hold`) | Skips scrolling for this one command even inside a `withScroll*` block (it resolves against the current screen only). Leaving the argument out follows the direction of the block. |

**`settle: false`** skips this command's post-action wait for the screen to settle (the next step may see a moving screen). See [tap](./tap.md) for details.

**Scrolling is specified only through each command's `scroll:` argument.** A direction (`.down` / `.up` / `.right` / `.left`)
searches while scrolling that way, and `.noScroll` never scrolls, even inside a `withScroll*` block. Leaving it out follows
the direction of the enclosing block (outside a block: the current screen only). There are no function-name aliases such as
`tapWithScrollDown` or `existWithoutScroll` (writing one gives a compile error that shows the `scroll:` form).

When `maxSwipes:` is omitted on a command with `scroll:` (`tap` / `exist` / `select`, etc.), it
swipes at most 8 times in that direction. It stops earlier once the list has reached its edge and
the content no longer moves (two swipes in a row leave the screen unchanged). Before giving up, it
searches once more in the opposite direction in smaller steps. If the element is still not found,
the command's usual handling applies (`exist` / `tap` fail, `select` returns an empty element); when
the search stopped at the edge, the failure message says so, because raising `maxSwipes` will not
help.

## Example

```swift
tap("Settings", scroll: .down)      // scroll to find the item behind a fold, then tap it
withScrollDown {
    tap("#row_40")                  // searched for even though not written explicitly
    exist("#header", scroll: .noScroll)   // a fixed header, checked on the current screen only
}
```

## The scrollable region: `scrollFrame:`

`scrollFrame:` (also `startMarginRatio:` / `endMarginRatio:`) is an argument on `scroll*` /
`scrollToBottom` etc. / `scrollTo`, and `withScroll*` takes `scrollFrame:` alone. It names, with a
selector, the region that should actually be scrolled — needed when a screen has more than one
scrollable area (a fixed header plus a scrollable list, for example):

```swift
scrollTo("#row_40", scrollFrame: "#list_rows")
```

- **Omitting it scrolls the whole screen**, centered, and margin ratios are ignored.
- `withScrollDown(scrollFrame: "#list") { }` passes the region down to every search inside the
  block.
- **If the region resolves but nothing in it actually moves**, the swipe is still sent but a note
  is left on the step (`the specified scrollFrame is not scrollable`, or
  `resolved but leaves nothing to move` if the margins leave no room).
- **In a half-open bottom sheet** (the given container touches the bottom edge of the screen and its top is
  below the top quarter of the screen), if a downward search never moved at all, it drags once, quickly, inside
  that container to expand the sheet and then searches again (note
  `the sheet was expanded by a drag inside the scrollFrame first`).
- **If the region does not resolve to anything on screen, the command fails without sending a
  single swipe** — this applies to `scrollTo`'s search, `scroll*` / `scrollTo*Edge`, `flick*`, and
  anything inside `withScroll*`. `select`-family commands are the one exception: they still
  return an empty element per their own contract rather than failing.

## Notes left on the report

These are observations, not failures:

| note | meaning | worth checking? |
|---|---|---|
| `stopped at the limit of N (may not have reached the edge yet)` | Stopped at `maxSwipes` — not necessarily the actual edge | **Yes.** Raise `maxSwipes`, or check whether the screen even has an edge to reach. |
| `the screen did not settle (poll limit)` | The screen was still moving after a swipe (long inertia, etc.). The swipe itself was still sent. | Usually not. If it appears at the same spot every run, a tap right after could land while the content is still moving — worth investigating. |
| `fell back to XCUITest` | The in-app bridge could not run this scroll, so XCUITest did it. | Usually not. If it happens a lot, reconsider the run profile's `iosMode`. |

## How fast an edge scroll runs

`scrollToBottom` etc. repeat "scroll once, then check whether the screen stopped moving." On Android, and on iOS in
xcuitest mode or Compose / Flutter, one step covers about one page, so raise `maxSwipes` for long screens (the default
`maxSwipes: 50` may not reach very long documents). iOS UIKit / SwiftUI and WebView with the in-app bridge, and the Android WebView, jump straight to
the edge, so they do not depend on document length. Chaining several `flick*` calls to go faster is not a substitute —
flick has no notion of having reached the edge; see [flick](./flick.md).

## Elements that only just peek in at the edge

When the element a search finds only just peeks in at the edge it is scrolling towards, and less than a finger's
width of it (44 pt / dp) is visible, fleetest slowly scrolls half the container once more before touching it.
Touching such a thin strip can be taken by the screen-edge gestures (Android's back and home) or land on
something else.
On iOS in the default `inapp-boost` mode, Compose Multiplatform and Flutter scroll exactly one page per swipe, so this extra scroll does not happen there.

## Container-inference corrections

`tap`/`scrollTo` etc. apply a set of corrections that rely on inferring the scroll container —
clipping detection, re-grabbing a stale element, a rescue drag, coordinate correction for a
partially visible element, and discarding a broken coordinate candidate. These are on by default;
turn them off only when they misfire on an unusual screen layout (a custom scroll container
implementation, for example). Three scopes to choose from:

| scope | how |
|---|---|
| whole run | environment variable `FT_CONTAINER_INFERENCE=off` (only to isolate a problem) — overrides all three below |
| one command | `tap(sel, containerInference: false)` / `scrollTo(sel, containerInference: false)` |
| a block | `withoutContainerInference { … }` (applies to `tap`/`exist`/`select` and every other command inside) |
| the whole run profile | the run profile's `containerInference: false` |

Excluding the environment variable, precedence is: explicit argument > block context > run
profile default.
