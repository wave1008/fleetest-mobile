# installApp, removeApp, clearAppData

[in Japanese(日本語)](install_app_ja.md)

Installs, uninstalls, or resets the data of the app under test.

## Functions

| function | description |
|---|---|
| `installApp(appPackageFile?)` | Installs the app (iOS: `.app`, Android: `.apk` or `.apks`; `.apks` needs bundletool on the Mac). Without `appPackageFile`, the app profile's `<platform>.appPath` (the app profile that the run profile's `app` points to) is used (an explicit path always wins over the profile). |
| `removeApp(appID?)` | Uninstalls the app. `appID` defaults the same way as `launchApp()`'s `appID` when omitted. |
| `clearAppData(appID?)` | Keeps the app installed but clears its data and permissions, so onboarding and permission dialogs reappear. `appID` defaults the same way as `launchApp()`'s `appID`. |

## Example

```swift
installApp()                       // path from the app profile's appPath
launchApp()                        // on iOS in `inapp-boost` mode, call it right after install
installApp("/path/to/MyApp.app")
clearAppData()                     // back to a first-run state
removeApp()
```

## Notes

- **On iOS in the default `inapp-boost` mode, call `launchApp()` right after `installApp()`.** The install ends the bridge inside the app, and
  operations such as `tap` do not reach the app until the next `launchApp()` reinjects it (the step carries the note `the in-app bridge
  will be reinjected on the next launchApp()`).
- **Reinstalling does not restore permissions.** On an iOS Simulator, uninstalling and
  reinstalling an app leaves TCC permissions (location, etc.) granted, and the permission
  dialogs do not reappear. A scenario that assumes "reinstall = first-run state" will not see
  them — use `clearAppData()` instead.
- **`clearAppData()` also resets permissions** (iOS TCC / Android runtime permissions) back to
  not-granted, so permission dialogs appear again. This is the command to reach for when testing
  onboarding or first-run permission flows.
- A physical iPhone has no way to clear only the app's data, so `clearAppData()` **reinstalls the app** there (it takes
  as long as an install; note `reinstalled-to-clear-data`). Set a device build in the app profile's `appPathPhysical`
  as the source to reinstall from, and run with `--profile`. If it cannot reinstall — no source, a different app
  (another bundle ID), or a Simulator build (which a physical device rejects) — it fails without uninstalling.
- `clearAppData()` clears `NSUserDefaults` / `SharedPreferences`, but **does not clear the
  Keychain (iOS) / Keystore (Android)**. If an app stores its "has been onboarded" flag there,
  first-run cannot be reproduced this way.
- **fleetest's own bridge cannot be the target.** Passing the bridge's ID (Android `com.example.ftbridge`, or the iOS runner whose ID ends in `.ftrunner`, `.ftrunner.uitests` or `.ftrunner.uitests.xctrunner`) to `removeApp` / `clearAppData`
  fails without sending anything — removing or wiping it would stop the bridge the run drives the device through.
- **Removing the app under test breaks the rest of the run** — call `removeApp()` on your own
  test target only when you mean to end the scenario there.
- **On Android (physical devices and Emulators alike), `adb install` verification (Play
  Protect's "Send app for a security check?") is turned off for the duration of the install and
  the device setting is restored afterwards.** The app under test is never sent to Google (with
  verification on, a release-signed APK leaves `adb install` blocked on that dialog — on an
  Emulator with Google Play just the same). Set `playProtectBypass` in the run profile to false (default true) to stop this.
