# dry-run

[in Japanese(日本語)](dry_run_ja.md)

`fleetest run --dry-run` enumerates and validates a scenario's
steps **without touching a device or calling FM**. It catches mistakes that would otherwise only
surface during, or after, a slow device run — in seconds.

```bash
fleetest run --dry-run --scenario LoginTest
```

MCP exposes the same check as `ft_dry_run`; the VSCode extension runs it via
`fleetest api run --dry-run` (the Test Explorer's "Run (dry-run)" action).

## What it catches

| Problem | How it's caught |
|---|---|
| Selector syntax errors | The selector expression parser runs before any device call |
| Mistakes inside `ifCanSelect { }` / `.ifElse { }` | In a dry-run **both blocks are executed** regardless of the condition, so selector syntax errors and unknown `#id`s inside either one are reported |
| An `expectation { }` block with zero assertions | Counted the same way `verify` counts assertions (`exist`/`notExist`/`textIs` and friends, `thisIs` variants, `appIs`; `select` does not count). A scenario with **zero** assertions overall gets a stronger warning |
| `#id`s that don't exist in any screen you've captured | Checked against the project's selector inventory (`<project>/.fleetest/selector-inventory.json`), built by `ft_snapshot` calls made while writing the scenario |
| Commands the profile's devices cannot run (only with `--profile`) | The commands of the steps that ran are checked against the kind of every device that could take the scenario (all devices of that OS). See the table below |

Notes on the last check: it only warns about screens you have actually captured — if the
inventory has no record for a given screen (or platform), dry-run stays silent rather than
guessing. It also stays silent while the inventory is thin: the warning only fires when at least
two thirds of a scenario's `#id`s are already in the inventory (a single captured screen would
otherwise flag most existing scenarios as wrong). Only exact-match `#id`s are checked — wildcard
forms (`#row_*`) and labels are excluded, since labels normally change with copy edits.

A dry-run is not static analysis: it actually executes the scenario and only skips the device
calls. So nothing is caught for content inside `ios { }` / `android { }` blocks that did not
execute for the platform being checked (to cover both OSes, dry-run once per platform).

## Commands the profile's devices cannot run

With `--profile`, a dry-run warns when one of the following commands cannot run on a device of that profile
(a ⚠️ line; the dry-run still passes or fails as before). On a device run these fail only when that step is reached
(`fold` / `unfold` / `hinge` on a device that cannot fold are still skipped as not applicable without being sent).
In the VSCode extension's dry-run the warnings appear in the Output panel, not in each test's result in the Test Explorer.

| Device | Commands warned about |
|---|---|
| Physical iPhone | `fold` / `unfold` / `hinge` / `addMedia` |

Only cases decided by **the command name alone** are warned about. These cannot be seen from a dry-run and are not checked:

- Decided by an argument: `tap(holdSeconds:)` (a long press, above 0), and `appIs` / `launchApp` / `restartApp` given another app
- Decided by the app's UI framework: `doubleTap` / `pinchOut` / `pinchIn` (UIKit / SwiftUI / RN), `swipe` / `flick*` / `scroll*`,
  and `clearInput` / `pressEnter` on Flutter

## What it does not do

- It never contacts a device or an Emulator/Simulator, and never calls FM.
- `--profile` is not used to prepare any device. It decides, from the profile's devices, which of `ios { }` /
  `android { }` is checked for scenarios that declare no platform (`ios` if the profile has an iOS device, otherwise
  `android`; the same rule as the VSCode extension's dry-run). Without a profile, `--platform` decides and the command
  check above does not run. MCP's `ft_dry_run` takes no profile, so it does not run this check.
- It does not write a report, and its result is not recorded for `--failed` to pick up later.

`--scenario` / `--folder` / `--project` / `--quiet` all work the same as a normal run, and a
failed check sets exit code `1` — so `fleetest run --dry-run` (with no `--scenario`) is a cheap
gate to run before every device run across a whole project.
