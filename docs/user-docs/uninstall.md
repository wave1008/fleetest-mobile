How to uninstall Fleetest.

## Ask your AI assistant

Ask your AI assistant as follows, and it carries out the steps below for you.

```text
Uninstall fleetest by following ../fleetest-mobile/docs/user-docs/uninstall.md.
```

## 0. Runner machines (if you use them)

If you use remote runner machines, delete the work area on each runner machine before removing fleetest from your Mac:

```bash
../fleetest-mobile/.build/debug/fleetest remote teardown <machine>
```

If you created a signing keychain on a runner machine for physical iPhones, delete it on the runner machine too (it
holds your signing key):

```bash
security delete-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/fleetest-signing.keychain-db
```

## 1. VSCode extension

Uninstall it from VSCode's Extensions view, then run `Developer: Reload Window` to stop the
extension (while the extension is running, it restarts the fleetest processes you stop).

## 2. Stop the fleetest processes

If you used the services in `scripts/compose.yaml`, stop and remove them before stopping the processes (while the work folder and the clone still exist).

```bash
../fleetest-mobile/.build/debug/fleetest services down     # stop this work folder's services
../fleetest-mobile/.build/debug/fleetest services reset    # remove containers, networks, named volumes and the records
```

If a resident `services up` is still running, use `services reset --force`.

Images you built yourself and images that were pulled stay in the container runtime; remove them with
`container image rm <name>` / `docker image rm <name>` if you no longer need them (for example `ghcr.io/wave1008/sut-ec-mobile-server:latest`, `postgres:16-alpine`).

This stops every fleetest process on this Mac, whichever work folder it belongs to (fleetest in your
other work folders stops too).

```bash
pgrep -fl 'fleetest-mcp|/fleetest (api|run|bridge|devices)|fleetest-(simstream|androidstream|devicepoll)|xcodebuild.*FleetestRunner'
pkill  -f 'fleetest-mcp|/fleetest (api|run|bridge|devices)|fleetest-(simstream|androidstream|devicepoll)|xcodebuild.*FleetestRunner'
```

## 3. Work folder and clone

Quit VSCode, then delete the work folder and the fleetest clone (by default `fleetest-mobile`
next to your work folder; with its build folder it takes a few GB) via Finder or `rm`.
If `.build` reappears after you delete them, fleetest processes are still running (step 2).

## 4. Leftover files

- `~/.fleetest` (records of runs on this Mac and the like), `~/Library/Logs/fleetest` (logs), and `~/Library/Caches/fleetest`
- `~/.config/fleetest/` (settings and test data kept only on this Mac). **If you keep passwords or other secrets in
  `dataset/` or in `secrets/<project>.env` (the secrets compose.yaml refers to), be sure to delete them**
- The VSCode user setting `fleetest.language` (harmless once the extension is removed)
- Virtual devices you created for fleetest, if you no longer need them — delete them from Xcode's
  "Devices and Simulators" or Android Studio's Device Manager

## 5. Your AI assistant's MCP registration

Claude Code's registration (`.mcp.json`) goes away with the work folder. If you registered the
server in your AI assistant's own settings, such as Codex, remove that registration too. For Codex:

```bash
codex mcp remove fleetest
```
